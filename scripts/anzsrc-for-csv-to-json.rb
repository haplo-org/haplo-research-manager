# prepare the codes for this script by:
# - finding the excel files for ANZSRC FoR classifications from the official website
# - the 2008 ones came in three files, levels 1, 2, and 3. These need to be put into one spreadsheet,
#    so copy/paste level 2 codes at the bottom of level 1, and level 3 after that. This ensures that
#    the JSON is structured to have the parents created before the children.
# - no other header fields should be present. In the end you have two long columns, one with code and one with title.
# - export to csv.
